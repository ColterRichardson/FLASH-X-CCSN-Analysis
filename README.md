# FLASH-X-CCSN-Analysis
This repository houses python and MATLAB routines that are used in the extraction and plotting of quantities output in the CCSN simulations performed in the FLASH-X framework.

## Prerequisites
The MATLAB code only requires the basic software provided by MATLAB.

The python code only requries *numpy*, *h5py*, *matplotlib*, and *ffmpeg**.

*Note *ffmpeg* is not required, but reccomended. Any other python movie making options in the Animate function in *matplotlib* should work with minimal alteration to the codes.

## Included Codes

* flash_x_analysis.py
  * CCSN_1D_CHK("Path to data directory")
  * CCSN_1D_PLT("Path to data directory")


## Set-up

## Examples

## TODO

Analysis codes have been written by Colter Richardson, Jesse Buffaloe, and Ran Chu.
The FLASH-X framework can be found https://flash-x.org/.
